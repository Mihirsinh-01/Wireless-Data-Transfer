# Wireless-Data-Transfer
Wireless Transmission of data between Laptops using Socket Programming in Python
<dl><dt><h2>NOTE:</h2><dt>
  <dd>Download Python_Project Folder and run project.py file iside it.</dd>
  <dd>Don't change the contents of the folder.</dd>
<dl><br>
  <dt><h2>Requirements: </h2></dt><br>
<dd>1) You will need 2 laptops and both the laptops connected over same wi-fi network ( For example: Connect both the laptop with your mobile phone HOTSPOT without internet connection. )<br><br>
  2) Both the laptop should have Anaconda installed in it to run the Project(Python) file. </dd>
</dl>
<br>
<dl><dt><h2>Steps to run the Project(Python) file and open it.…</h2></dt><br>
  <dd><b>Step 1: </b> Open Anaconda Prompt(Anaconda 3) app in your laptop.<br>
    <center><img src="image/search.png"></center></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 2: </b>Go to the directory where this Project(Python) file is located.<br></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 3: </b>Run this ( python project.py ) command in the prompt.<br>
    <center><img src="goto_directory"></center></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 4: </b>After running the previous command a GUI (Tkinter) window will pop up.<br>

 <dl><h2>How the Project works….</h2>
 <dt>1) To Connect :</dt><br>
  <dd><b>Step 1: </b>The user which clicks the BLUE file explorer button becomes the HOST and the HOSTNAME is generated at the RIGHT–TOP corner.<br>
    <center><img src="hostname.png"></center></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 2: </b>The user which clicks the YELLOW file explorer button becomes the CLIENT.<br>
    <center><img src="client.png"></center></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 3: </b>To connect the client to the host type the HOSTNAME in the RIGHT-TOP corner on the CLIENT side and press ENTER.<br</dd>
  <dd><b>Step 4: </b>CONNECTED is displayed at the center of both the GUI, so it means the connection is established.<br>

  <br>
  <dt>2) To Transfer :</dt><br>
  <dd><b>Step 1: </b>Anyone (CLIENT or HOST) can press the SELECT FILE button after the connection is established.<br>

  <dd><b>Step 2: </b>Select the media that is to be transferred and press Open.<br></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 3: </b>Press the Data Transfer Button located in between the Blue and Yellow file explorer button.<br>
    <center><img src="cl2.png"></center></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 4: </b>Media file will be RECEIVED in the same folder location where the Project(Python) file is located.<br></dd>
  <dd><b>Step 5: </b>Wait until the data is transferred and then you can again ENJOY with transferring more and more data that too without INTERNET.<br></dd>
  <br>
  <dt>3) To Disconnect:</dt><br>
  <dd><b>Step 1: </b>Just simply close your GUI (Tkinter) to disconnect the host and the client connection.<br>

  <dl><dt><h2>Advantages: </h2></dt>
  <dd>1) Wireless Media(Audio+Video) Transfer amongst two laptops over same Wi-Fi network without using INTERNET Source.</dd>
  <dd>2) HOST can send data to CLIENT as well as CLIENT can sent data to HOST but not at the same time.</dd>
